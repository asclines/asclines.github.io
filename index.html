					 <h1>When a standard resume isn't enough</h1> 
						<p>Hey and welcome! My name is Alexander Clines and the purpose of this website is to go beyond what a resume can accomplish. Here you can find more about me than you ever could on a one page resume. In the <a href="resume.html">Resume Section</a> you will find a more comprehensive resume, containing all those things that you might want to know about me but could not find a home on my standard resume. In addition, you will also be able to visit my <a href="projects.html"> Projects Section</a> where you can see my work. It's one thing to say I know a language, it's another to show that I know a language and with this website, I aim to do both.  </p>	 
		  
					<br>
		  
					<h2>Why isn't there a lot here?</h2>
						<p>Yes, this website is pretty sparse. That can be attributed to two things. </p>
						<p>First and foremost, in case you haven't seen my resume yet, web design is <b>not</b> on there. That being said I am currently self-learning it now and this website is more or less the gym at which I am training my website design skills. So check back in every now and then and you will see the progression in my training.
						</p>
						<p>
						Secondly, I am still in college, so I haven't been around that long. On top of that, as you probably remember, college is pretty time consuming. Between the various classes, studying, doing homework, and being involved in organizations, I keep pretty busy. On top of that, I spend a lot of time helping others with their work and projects as well. So, while I would love to spend all day working on various projects of my own, I must uphold a certain rule that I was initially  forced to obey by my mother, and then later on came to accept as my way of life. A rule that has gotten me this far, and I expect to get me farther. That rule is <b>academics first</b></p>
