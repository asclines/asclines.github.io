# Welcome!

My name is Alexander Clines and I am currently attending Texas Tech University where I am completing a dual degree program in Computer Science, B.S. and Mathematics, B.S. In addition to that, I am starting on a degree in Mathematics, M.S.  
However, the degree is about to be put on hold as this summer (July 17th to be exact) I will be starting work at Google! I intend to finish graduate school, but I could not pass up an opportunity to work for Google.

My goal in life, and more specifically my future career, is to find a way to apply my various skills in ways that actually make a difference in the world.  This goal is not for fame or riches, but rather to contribute to the greater effort of pushing humanity forward and stretching the limits of technology in a meaningful way.  

# This site
Initially, the reason why I made a personal website was to just simply get my name and resume online. But now, as time goes on, both this website and I have grown.
To contact me or to find me on other parts of the web, just click the button on the bottom right to see the sidebar for more!

## When a standard resume isn't enough
This website is intended to go beyond what a simple, one page resume can do. Here you can find more information about me, extended details on the items that do appear on my resume as well as accomplishments, experiences, etc. that I have done yet did not make it to my resume. On the [About page](/about) you not just find a link to my standard resume, but you will find that this page acts as a more comprehensive resume, containing all those things that you might want to know about me but could not find a home on my standard resume.

## Showcase of my work
They say a picture is worth a thousand words. How many words is a project worth?
On my [Github profile](https://github.com/asclines), you will find a showcase of the projects I am most proud of. It's one thing to say I know a language, it's another to show that I know it and with this website, I aim to do both.

## Competitive Programming Problem Editorials
I really, really enjoy doing competitive programming problems and participating in online competitive programming contests on sites like [CodeForces](http://codeforces.com) and [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com). I have started recently to write up editorials of some problems I have solved and will be posting them in the blog section. For more information on that check out the [CPP Editorials Overview post](/CPP-Editorials-Overview). While the editorials are intended to help people get into competitive programming, I hope they also can serve as a showcase of my competitive programming skills.
