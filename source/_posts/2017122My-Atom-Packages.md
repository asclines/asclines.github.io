So several people have asked me what packages am I using in Atom so I have decided to write a post on what Atom packages I use and for what purpose I use them for. So with that, here's a list of what Atom packages I have right now.
<!-- more -->

# General Atom Plugins
_These packages are good to have in general for working with Atom_
## [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify)
> Beautify HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, C, C++, C#, Objective-C, CoffeeScript, TypeScript, Coldfusion, SQL, and more in Atom

I use this plugin to bring conformity/consistency to my code as I write. With a simple hotkey `Ctrl + Alt + B` I can make my source code look good. I use this to clean up source code for these languages:
- C/C++
- JavaScript
- Python

## [git-time-machine](https://atom.io/packages/git-time-machine)
> Visually interact with git commit history for a file

Makes it much easier to visualize the history of a file in git.

## [markdown-preview-plus](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-plus)
> Markdown Preview + Community Features

## [minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap)
> A preview of the full source code.

Similar to how Sublime works, provides an easy/visual way to quickly navigate to certain parts of a file.

## [pdf-view](https://atom.io/packages/pdf-view)
> Atom PDF viewer based on PDF.js

View PDFs in Atom. Especially useful when working with Latex.

## [project-manager](https://atom.io/packages/project-manager)
> Project Manager for easy access and switching between projects in Atom.

This is a must have. If you find yourself working on several projects at the same time, this package is for you!

## [sync-settings](https://atom.io/packages/sync-settings)
> Synchronize package settings, keymap and installed packages

I use Atom on two computers, this allows me to make sure that no matter what computer I am on, I'll have the same Atom experience.

# Linters
_Great for catching errors before they become problems._

## [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter)
> A Base Linter with Cow Powers

This package is required as a base for the linters that are langauge specific.

## [linter-chktex](https://atom.io/packages/linter-chktex)
> Linter plugin for LaTeX, using chktex


## [linter-pylint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-pylint)
> Lint python on the fly, using pylint


# Web Development
_Whether it's a website or webapp, these plugins many be useful._

## [atom-polymer](https://atom.io/packages/atom-polymer)
> Develop for Polymer 1.0+ faster with Atom.

Brings in several very useful hotkeys and auto completion for when I am working on a Polymer app.
However, I may not keep this package is does get a little annoying when I am working on HTML and JavaScript files that are not part of a Polymer project.

## [autoclose-html](https://atom.io/packages/autoclose-html)
> Automates closing of HTML Tags

Reasoning for this should be self-explanatory.

## [polymer-snippets](https://atom.io/packages/polymer-snippets)
> Polymer Snippets for Atom

More autocompletion for Polymer.


## [tag](https://atom.io/packages/tag)
> Sublime Text-inspired HTML & XML Tag menu and functions. Close Tag

When you open a tag in HTML, this closes it.

# Latex
_ I write a lot in Latex, whether its for a paper or a presentation, these plugins make it easier._

## [language-latex](https://atom.io/packages/language-latex)
> Syntax highlighting for LaTeX for Atom

## [latex](https://atom.io/packages/latex)
> Compile LaTeX documents from within Atom.

## [latexer](https://atom.io/packages/latexer)
> Adds LaTex autocompletion for Atom.io


Hopefully this helps! I'll update this list as I add/remove packages.
